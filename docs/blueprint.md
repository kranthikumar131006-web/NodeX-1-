- Background color: Nearly white (#FAFAFA), complementary to the primary and easy on the eyes for prolonged use.
- Accent color: A violet (#8A2BE2), contrasting with the desaturated light blue, suggests creativity and signals interactive elements.
- Headline font: 'Poppins', sans-serif, for a geometric, contemporary, fashionable, avant-garde look. Body font: 'PT Sans', sans-serif, for its modern look combined with warmth and personality.  'Poppins' will be used for headlines and shorter content, and 'PT Sans' will be used for longer form body text.
